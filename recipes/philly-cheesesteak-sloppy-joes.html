    <h2>Description</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp organic canola oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup no-salt-added tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sauteed peppers & Onions <em>(See associated recipe)</em></li>
        <li>4 (6 inch) whole-whet sub rolls, split</li>
        <li>4 slices reduced-sodium provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange oven rack in upper third of oven. Preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, oregano and salt; cook, crumbling 
            with a wooden spoon, until cooked thoroughly, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, warm peppers and onions in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring often. 
            (Alternatively, microwave for 1 minute to reheat.)</li>

        <li>Lay rolls, split-side open, on the prepared baking sheet. Broil, rotating the pan as necessary, until 
            just starting to brown and toast, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Top toasted buns with beef mixture, dividing evenly. Top with the peppers and onions and then cheese. Broil just until the cheese 
            is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Wrap each sub in foil until ready to eat.<br>
            Serve hot.
        </li>
